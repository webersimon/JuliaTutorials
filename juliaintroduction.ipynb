    "\n",
    "## 1. A brief overview of Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a fairly recent programming language, started in 2009. It's part of crowded field that includes\n",
    "- Matlab\n",
    "- R\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Stata\n",
    "- C\n",
    "- Fortran\n",
    "\n",
    "and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "I am not an advocate of any particular language, but rather believe in choosing the right tool for the job. I find Julia particularly good for scientific computing, optimization, parallel computing. Some of its avantages are\n",
    "- Free and open source\n",
    "- Fast\n",
    "- Growing library of packages for e.g. optimization, data visualization, machine learning, parallel computing, etc.\n",
    "- Choice of good integrated development environments (IDEs)\n",
    "- Creating packages and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, learning about a new language, the best practices for that language and some of the packages available in that language can can point us in the right direction to solve a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Julia ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of well-established Julia packages:\n",
    "- Linear Algebra: ```LinearAlgebra.jl```, ```SparseArrays.jl```\n",
    "- Data and data visualization: ```DataFrames.jl```, ```CSV.jl```, ```ReadStatTables.jl```, ```Plots.jl```, ```PyPlot.jl``` \n",
    "- Optimization: ```JuMP.jl```, ```Optim.jl```\n",
    "- Differentiation: ```ForwardDiff.jl```, ```FiniteDifferences.jl```\n",
    "- Econometrics: ```GLM.jl```\n",
    "- Parallel computing: ```Distributed.jl```\n",
    "- Machine learning: ```MLJ.jl```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "![](benchmarks.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "(source: https://julialang.org/benchmarks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lingering issues\n",
    "- Still a new language so regular updates mean updating code regularly\n",
    "- Smaller library of well established packages\n",
    "- Some things that \"just work\" in other languages won't in Julia\n",
    "- Documentation is sometimes lacking\n",
