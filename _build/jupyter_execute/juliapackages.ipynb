    "In this section, I cover briefly how to create a Julia package (along with using GitHub). These notes are based on the Pkg package documentation (https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a GitHub repository for the package\n",
    "1. Create an account on GitHub\n",
    "2. Create a public or private repository for the package, for example \"example\"\n",
    "3. Install GitHub desktop (useful to sync changes made to the book) and clone the package repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Julia\n",
    "Julia can downloaded at https://julialang.org/. A good IDE for Julia is Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the package\n",
    "In the Julia terminal, type \"]\" to enter the Pkg REPL. To create the package \"example\", type\n",
    "```\n",
    "generate example\n",
    "```\n",
    "Locate the folder \"example\" and copy the files (a \"Project.toml\" file which contain some useful information about the package such as the name, ID, dependencies, etc and a \"src\" folder that contains a Julia file \"example.jl\") to the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editing the package\n",
    "We can now edit the \"example.jl\" file and add the following to it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "module example\n",
    "\n",
    "fun() = println(\"This is the example package!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing the package\n",
    "Once the package files have been edited, we need to commit any changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository. To install the package, type\n",
    "```\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(path=\"path_to_package\")\n",
    "``` \n",
    "alternatively \n",
    "```\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(url=\"url_to_package\")\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the package is installed\n",
    "```\n",
    "using example\n",
    "example.fun()\n",
    "```\n",
    "should produce \"This is the example package!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding dependencies\n",
    "Let's add the following function in our example.jl main file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import Dates\n",
    "funtime() = println(Dates.now())\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function \"now()\" will print the date and is part of the package \"Dates\". To add Dates as a dependency to the example package, enter the Pkh REPL and type\n",
    "```\n",
    "activate path_to_package\n",
    "add Dates\n",
    "```\n",
    "Commit all changes and reinstall the package with Pkg (we may need to restart Julia first). Then\n",
    "```\n",
    "using example\n",
    "example.funtime()\n",
    "```\n",
    "should produce the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
