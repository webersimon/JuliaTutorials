    "Unfortunately, there are issues when building a jupyter book when using more recent versions of python. To avoid this, we will use an older version of Python (python 3.7). To easily switch between versions of python, we will create a specific environment which will contain python 3.7. To do this, we open the Anaconda Prompt and type\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name python37 python=3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "where \"python37\" is the name we give to that environment (could be anything). \n",
    "To activate this envrionment, we open the Anaconda Prompt and type\n",

    "1. Create an account on GitHub\n",
